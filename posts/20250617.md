# Books That Changed My Perspective

There are certain books that stay with you long after you've closed them. They shift something inside you, change how you see the world, or introduce you to ideas that become part of who you are.

Recently, I've been reflecting on which books have had the most impact on my life. Some taught me about resilience, others about empathy. Some opened my eyes to different cultures and ways of thinking.

## The Right Book at the Right Time

I think the books that affect us most deeply are often the ones we encounter at just the right moment - when we're ready to hear what they have to say. They find us when we need them most.

### Fiction vs Non-Fiction

Both have their place in transformation:

- **Fiction** teaches us empathy by letting us live other lives
- **Non-fiction** gives us frameworks for understanding our world
- **Poetry** captures emotions we couldn't express ourselves

## A Living Library

The books on my shelf aren't just objects - they're conversations waiting to happen, worlds ready to be revisited, and teachers patient enough to share their wisdom again and again.

What books have changed your perspective? I'd love to hear about the stories that shaped you.
