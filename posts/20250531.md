# The Stories We Tell Ourselves

We are all storytellers, constantly narrating our lives to ourselves. The stories we choose to tell can either limit us or liberate us.

## The Internal Narrator

That voice in your head isn't just observing your life—it's interpreting it, creating meaning, telling you who you are and what's possible for you.

Common limiting stories:

- "I'm not good with technology"
- "I'm terrible at math"
- "I'm not a creative person"
- "I'm bad with people"

## Stories as Self-Fulfilling Prophecies

When we tell ourselves we can't do something, we often don't try. When we don't try, we don't improve. When we don't improve, it confirms our story.

## Rewriting the Narrative

The beautiful thing about stories is they can be rewritten:

- "I'm not good with technology" → "I'm learning to be more comfortable with technology"
- "I'm terrible at math" → "Math is challenging for me, but I can improve with practice"
- "I'm not creative" → "I'm discovering my unique forms of creativity"

## The Origin of Our Stories

Many of our self-limiting stories come from:

- Things others said about us in childhood
- Early failures or embarrassments
- Comparing ourselves to others
- Societal messages about what we "should" be

## Identity vs. Behavior

There's a crucial difference between "I am bad at public speaking" (identity) and "I haven't developed strong public speaking skills yet" (behavior that can change).

## Empowering Stories

What if we told ourselves different stories:

- "I'm someone who faces challenges with curiosity"
- "I'm continuously growing and learning"
- "I'm resilient and can handle whatever comes my way"
- "I'm worthy of love and belonging"

## The Power of "Yet"

One small word can transform a limiting story: "yet."

- "I can't do this" → "I can't do this yet"
- "I don't understand" → "I don't understand yet"

## Questioning Our Stories

Start noticing the stories you tell yourself. Ask:

- Is this story serving me?
- Is it absolutely true?
- What would be possible if I believed something different?

We are both the author and the protagonist of our life story. We get to choose how it goes.
