# The Art of Morning Routines

There's something sacred about the early morning hours. Before the world fully awakens, there's a quietness that allows for reflection and intention-setting.

## My Current Morning Ritual

Over the years, I've crafted a morning routine that feels both grounding and energizing:

- **5:30 AM** - Wake without an alarm (when possible)
- **5:45 AM** - Ten minutes of meditation
- **6:00 AM** - Journal writing with coffee
- **6:30 AM** - Light stretching or walk
- **7:00 AM** - Read something inspiring

## The Power of Consistency

What I've learned is that it's not about having the perfect routine, but about showing up consistently. Even on days when I can only manage five minutes of journaling, that small act of intention makes a difference.

The morning routine isn't just about productivityâ€”it's about creating space for yourself before giving your energy to the world.
