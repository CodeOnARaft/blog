# The Science of Small Habits

We often underestimate the power of small, consistent actions. We want dramatic transformations, but real change happens quietly, one small habit at a time.

## The 1% Rule

If you improve by just 1% each day, you'll be 37 times better by the end of the year. It sounds too simple to be true, but the math is undeniable.

## Tiny Habits, Big Results

Some small habits that have made a surprising impact:

- Reading one page before bed
- Doing five push-ups every morning
- Writing one sentence in my journal
- Drinking one extra glass of water

## The Power of Consistency

It's not about the size of the actionâ€”it's about the consistency. A small habit done every day beats a big effort done sporadically.

## Making It Stick

The key is to make habits so small they're almost impossible to fail at. Once the behavior becomes automatic, you can gradually increase the intensity.

## Identity-Based Change

The most powerful habit changes come from shifting your identity. Instead of "I'm trying to write," think "I'm a writer who writes daily."

Small habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
