# Learning from Children

We spend so much time teaching children how to be adults that we forget what they can teach us about being human.

## Natural Curiosity

Children ask "why" about everything. As adults, we often stop asking why and start accepting things as they are. What if we maintained that sense of wonder?

## Present Moment Awareness

Watch a child play. They're completely absorbed in what they're doing. No multitasking, no mental to-do lists, just full engagement with the present moment.

## Authentic Expression

Children haven't yet learned to hide their emotions or pretend to be someone they're not. They laugh when they're happy, cry when they're sad, and express exactly what they're feeling.

## Fearless Creativity

Give a child art supplies and they'll create without worrying about whether it's "good." They haven't developed the inner critic that tells us our ideas aren't worth pursuing.

## Quick Recovery

Children can be devastated one moment and delighted the next. They don't hold onto disappointment or nurse grudges. They move on with remarkable resilience.

## Learning Without Ego

Children aren't embarrassed to not know something. They ask questions freely and learn rapidly because they're not worried about looking foolish.

## Simple Pleasures

A cardboard box can entertain a child for hours. They find joy in simple things that adults overlook in the pursuit of more sophisticated pleasures.

## Living in Wonder

Everything is new and amazing to a child. The same walk you've taken a hundred times is an adventure full of discoveries when seen through their eyes.

## The Wisdom to Remember

We don't need to become childish, but we can become more childlike:

- Stay curious
- Be present
- Express authentically
- Create fearlessly
- Forgive quickly
- Learn eagerly
- Find joy in simple things
- Maintain wonder

Perhaps growing up doesn't mean leaving behind all childlike qualitiesâ€”perhaps it means choosing which ones to keep.
